# Cedric's Notes for code-301n24 course

## Consider the history: That Time When Women Stopped Coding
What occurred during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science?

The share of women in computer science started falling at roughly the same moment when personal computers started showing up in U.S. homes in significant numbers.

Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?

Naratives being spun towards boys and men marketing early personal computers more than likely contributed to the decline of women in computer science.


Review the data: Employee breakdown of key technology companies
What three take-a-ways do you have looking at this data?

There are more White Males in tech
than any other ethnic/gender catagory

The number of Females in tech is disporportionate and scarse compared to Males

People who identify as Multi or Other have the lowest share of inclusion in tech.


Ask the question: Why diversity matters to your tech company

When are diversity efforts most successful?

Diverse teams are smarter and more creative

Why do diverse companies perform better?

In a 2011 study of diversity in the top firms in Standard & Poor's Composite 1500 list, researchers found “female representation in top management leads to an increase of $42 million in firm value.”

And in a 2003 study looking at 177 banks across the U.S., researchers found that for banks focused on innovation, racial diversity was clearly tied to better financial performance. Research also links gender representation at the executive and board level with better company performance.  

Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.

When the employees of an organization better represent their users and desired users, they will build more effectively for those groups. When YouTube’s almost entirely right-handed developer team built the iOS app without considering how left-handed people would use it, for example, 5% to 10% of videos were uploaded upside down as a result. This factor may be especially relevant for leaders of consumer tech companies.
