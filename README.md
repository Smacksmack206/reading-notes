My Name is Cedric Vallieu

I'm head of support at DevHub 

My typical day to day is managing the frontlines of devhub support channels mantaining our SLAs with clients, running data reports, and resolving issues with errors and bugs and SSL on sites and proxys for major brands and enterprises utilizing our technology working directly under the CEO and CTO.
