# About Me

My Name is Cedric Vallieu

Here is the link to my [GitHub](https://github.com/Smacksmack206).

I'm head of support at DevHub :+1: 

My typical day to day is managing the frontlines of devhub support channels mantaining our SLAs with clients, running data reports, and resolving issues with errors and bugs and SSL on sites and proxys for major brands and enterprises utilizing our technology working directly under the CEO and CTO.

- [ ] My goal is to complete Code Fellows and fill in my gaps of knowledge and become some sort of cross functional software as a service executive at my organization. 

## I love running, virtual reality, driving, and relaxing


### Enjoying my time here at code fellows so far*
