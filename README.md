#Cedric's Notes for code-102n57 course

# About Me

My Name is Cedric Vallieu

Here is the link to my [GitHub](https://github.com/Smacksmack206).

I'm head of support at DevHub :+1: 

My typical day to day is managing the frontlines of devhub support channels mantaining our SLAs with clients, running data reports, and resolving issues with errors and bugs and SSL on sites and proxys for major brands and enterprises utilizing our technology working directly under the CEO and CTO.

- [ ] My goal is to complete Code Fellows and fill in my gaps of knowledge and become some sort of cross functional software as a service executive at my organization. 

##I love running, virtual reality, driving, and relaxing


###Enjoying my time here at code fellows so far

1. My day started at 6 am resolving errors for sites and proxys at work and my day won't be over until class is done tonight and my son is asleep in bed for school.
2. Time flies when your having fun so this last hour will be quick!
3. Glad that I already am familiar with Github and Git with previous personal projects I had for myself earlier on in life - I don't use these currently at work

## Requirements

- Explain “growth mindset” in your own words

**Growth mindset for me is having honest self reflection everyday to further your skill set and knowledge through trial and error and challenging yourself**

<br>

- Include 3 reminders to yourself of how to keep yourself in a growth mindset

1. Ask for help when needed to fill in any gaps

2. Go out of your comfort zone and try new things, share your thoughts when you might normally might not have

3. Set goals along the way, never reach an arrived mentality with anything.
